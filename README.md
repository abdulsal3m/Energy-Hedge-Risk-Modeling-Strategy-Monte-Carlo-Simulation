# Strategic Hedging Optimization & Risk Analytics for Energy-Intensive Operations (ERCOT, 2025)

This repository contains a comprehensive data analytics and financial modeling project that explores hedge strategy performance and risk mitigation for energy-intensive operations such as data centers and cryptocurrency mining operating within the ERCOT Texas Energy market. The study focuses on comparing Load Zone vs. Hub-based hedging instruments, measuring their profitability, volatility shielding, and operational viability through real-world forward pricing data, custom simulations, and quantitative modeling.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze the financial impact of real-time market exposure versus hedge-based electricity procurement.
- Evaluate performance of Load Zone (LZ_WEST) and Hub-based (HB_WEST, HB_NORTH) hedging contracts.
- Integrate **basis risk**, **fixed basis contracts**, and **CRRs** into comprehensive hedge strategy comparisons.
- Simulate operational risk using **Monte Carlo Simulation ** to measure uncertainty, Sharpe ratios, and tail loss scenarios.
- Deliver decision-ready insights for cost optimization, risk shielding, and hedge timing.
